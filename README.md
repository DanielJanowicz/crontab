# Crontab with Python deployed on a Virtual Machine:


## main.py

This python file pulls data down from an API (chosen) that gets updated every day.

## crontab.md

This markdown file displays the code for three different ways of running the main.py file at different times.  More information is found within the file.

## resources.md

This is just another markdown file that houses the resources used in this repo.  This is primarily meant to refer back to in the future, or others can utilize it for their own repo.
